We are building a fitness tracking and diet recommendation application targeting about 12,000 active users per month. The budget is ₹30,000 per month. The backend is implemented using Node.js, with MongoDB for flexible user health data storage. User images and reports are stored in object storage, and basic analytics are used to track activity trends. The system must ensure data privacy, support high write operations, scale analytics processing, and provide continuous uptime monitoring.
